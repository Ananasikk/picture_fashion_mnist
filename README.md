## Welcome!
Per pixel drawing images from the training set Fashion MNIST
#### Why did I make this program?
In the process of creating scientific project I needed images in jpg format from dataset Fashion MNIST. For a long time I have been trying to find on the Internet this dataset in jpg format with labels. But unsuccessfully. I hope my program will save you a lot of time.

#### How it works
You should unpack files: ___fashion-mnist_train.zip___ and ___fashion-mnist_test.zip___. Then you need to run the program. We are dealing with 70000 picture so you should wait 3-5 minutes. The images will appear in the directory ___fashion_mnist___.
