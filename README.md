## Welcome!
Per pixel drawing images from the training set Fashion MNIST
#### Why did I make this program?
In the process of creating scientific project I needed images in jpg format from dataset Fashion MNIST. For a long time I have been trying to find on the Internet this dataset in jpg format with labels. But unsuccessfully. I hope my program will save you a lot of time.
